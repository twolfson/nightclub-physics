## Background
I, Todd Wolfson, am a programmer by career and dancer (freeform) by hobby. I've been dancing and going to nightclubs regularly since 2009.

At the time of writing, I've been dancing on the US East Coast, US West Coast, Israel, Mexico, Japan, and the US Mid-west.

There's a lot of details that you slowly pick up over time. This is my brain dump of that information.

I should state up-front that I'm a tall white male and these experiences have been during my early to mid-20's. Your experiences/observations may vary and please read this with a grain of salt.

## Topics to cover
- [x] Behaviors (e.g. salmon, circles, finding space/traps)
- [ ] Subcultures/Appearances (e.g. goth, kandi kid)
- [ ] Undergrounds and you (e.g. info lines, TBA/TBD)
- [ ] Personal notes (e.g. photos, compliments)
- [ ] City differences (e.g. smoking, distance)
- [ ] Deep knowledge
    - People
        - Inbound - Promoters, boards, artists/DJs
        - Venue - Bouncer, entry clerk, coat clerk, bartender, bar-back, servers, attendees, bathroom clerk
    - Bartender attention and tippping
        - Be nice to bartender since they took time to serve you, always tip even for water
        - Free drink guide (never tried) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLNJjUuDLDM

## Behaviors
Over time people pick up behaviors, either out of habit or observation. These are common ones that you will notice.

### Salmon
A salmon is someone who pushes past other people to get to the front of the crowd, only to immediately rush to the back with more pushing/shoving.

I know I came across this definition somewhere but have no recollection where.

I should note that you could also be standing/dancing in a through-way, which is a valid spot, but the people walking past you are not salmon. If you dance in this spot, then please move/dance out of the way so there is no blockage.

### Statue
A statue is someone who stands still on the dancefloor.

As a dancer, it's extremely frustrating since we are usually struggling to find space.

I have no idea why this behavior occurs but it does =(

### Circles
Dance circles are probably the most common occurrence you will see. These are when people clear out space and 1 or 2 persons dance in the center for a song or less.

**How they are formed:**

I have seen circles formed in 2 ways:

- Someone starts dancing really good, others start looking/moving back, and eventually there's enough padding that a circle has formed
- Someone (usually drunk) sees a good dancer and starts pushing people back/drawing attention to the dancer
    - These ones usually don't last very long

**How they work:**

People on the outside look in and watch the dancer in the center. You can dance on the outside but don't go all out; have respect for the dancer in the circle.

When the person out of the center, another dancer can replace them.

If you have already danced before, you can re-enter the circle but don't hog the circle (you will probably get tired as is).

**How they end:**

When people stop re-entering the circle, there's usually a pause. Then everyone starts dancing and the circle collapses.

### Finding space
Finding space to dance can be finnicky. There are a few things that impact dancefloor density:

- Time, usually every city as a "peak" when the club is most packed
    - The dancefloor will be less packged before/after peak
    - For example, in Chicago peak is usually from midnight to 1:30AM. However, this can vary between venues (e.g. different closing times) and definitely varies between cities
- Artist/DJ, crowds usually have a shared taste so people will go get drinks/smoke if they aren't digging a set
- Location, typically the sides and back of a dancefloor are least crowded
    - Unfortunately, these are also usually throughways so be aware and be sure to move for people passing through

Due to my height, I can usually see openings through people or with a hop/jump.

One nuance I want to mention is traps. These are almost open spaces that can be found in the middle of the dancefloor. Unfortunately, they can sometimes collapse quickly and you will be left with virtually no space.

My rule of thumb for traps is only move to them if there's at least 1.5x the amount of space that I want.

## Subcultures/Appearances
Depending on your city and venue, you may encounter subcultures that you haven't seen before. This is not meant to be an all-encompassing list but is highlights from my experience.

### Goth
Dark clothing and distinct music. Usually found at a venue catered to this subculture.

### Kandi kids
A raver who wears plastic jewelry (aka kandi).
