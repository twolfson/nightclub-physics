## Background
I, Todd Wolfson, am a programmer by career and dancer (freeform) by hobby. I've been dancing and going to nightclubs regularly since 2009. At the time of writing, I've been dancing on the US East Coast, US West Coast, Israel, Mexico, Japan, and the US Mid-west.

There's a lot of details that you slowly pick up over time. This is my brain dump of that information.

I should state up-front that I'm a white male and these experiences have been during my early to mid-20's. Your experiences/observations may vary and please read this with a grain of salt.

## Topics to cover
- [ ] Behaviors (e.g. salmon, circles, traps)
- [ ] Subcultures/Appearances (e.g. goth, kandi kid)
- [ ] Undergrounds and you (e.g. info lines, TBA/TBD)
- [ ] City differences (e.g. smoking, distance)

## Further information
